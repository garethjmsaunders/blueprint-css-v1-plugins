## 960gs

This plugin was aiming to create a variety of alternative grids for projects I was working on at the time.

* 960px wide, 12 columns (similar to [960 grid system](https://960.gs/))
* 720px wide, 16 columns
* 970px wide, 24 columns

## append-x-colborder

This plugin was also addressing a simple problem that I faced on a project. I needed to combine both the `.append` and `.colborder` classes to throw a few column spaces with a right-hand column border.

## precolborder

This plugin did the opposite to colborder: this adds a column border to the previous column.

## rows

This plugin aligns elements to the grid height.

A set of classes to set the height of elements to fit the vertical rhythm of the grid (dictated by the line-height of 18px).

Sixty-seven (67) rows are offered, which covers all screen resolution heights up to WUXGA (1920 x 1200).

The first row is offered as both .row-1 and .rows-1 for pedants like me.
